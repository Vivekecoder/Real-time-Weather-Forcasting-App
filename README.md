# Real-time-Weather-Forcasting-App
This is a real-time weather forecast application using Tkinter(i.e. Python's built-in GUI library), This project is combination of  both GUI programming and API integration.



Creating a real-time weather forecast using Tkinter, a Python GUI toolkit, involves a few steps:-


1. Import Necessary Libraries: we'll need Tkinter for the GUI, and a library to fetch weather data. For simplicity, we'll use the requests library to fetch data from an online weather API.

2. Design the GUI: we'll create a Tkinter window with labels to display weather information and an entry field for the user to input the location.

3. Fetch Weather Data: Use an online weather API to fetch current weather data based on the user's input location.

4. Display Weather Data: Update the labels in the Tkinter window with the fetched weather information.
